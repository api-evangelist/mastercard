            Indicates whether this error will always be returned for this
            request, or retrying could change the outcome. For example, if the
            request contains an invalid   signature, retrying will never result
            in a success. However, if the error is related to some unexpected
            timeout with the service, retrying the call could result in a
            successful response.
