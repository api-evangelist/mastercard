### Mastercard MATCH Pro
The Mastercard Alert To Control High-risk Merchants (MATCH Pro) system allows an Authorized User to assess potential risks associated with a Merchant prior to enabling Mastercard acceptance, with the opportunity to develop and review enhanced or incremental risk information before entering into a Merchant agreement. MATCH Pro is a mandatory system for Mastercard Acquirers, unless exempted by Mastercard, or prohibited by law. The MATCH Pro database includes customer-reported information about MATCH Merchants (and their owners) that an Authorized user has terminated. When an Acquirer considers onboarding a MATCH Merchant, MATCH Pro can assist Acquirers with risk determinations during onboarding. By making independent risk determinations, Acquirers are able to add MATCH Merchants who have been added to MATCH PRO.

### Mastercard Authentication Facilitator
The Authentication Facilitator API is a building block of the Mastercard Authentication Service that enables MDES token requestors to authenticate cardholders leveraging cardholder information maintained by card issuers. The Token Requestor determines when cardholder authentication has to take place for its own program. The Token Requestor is also responsible for specifying and implementing the actions required by the business logic resulting from the authentication code validation information returned by the Authentication Service.
