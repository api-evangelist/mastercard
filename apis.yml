      Automatic Billing Updater (ABU) is a web service that provides access to
      updated account credentials (cards). This can be leveraged by
      Merchant/Acquirers/Payment Service Providers to ensure that they always
      have their customers' most up to date card credentials on file; the main
      benefit being a big reduction in declines for recurring and card-on-file
      payments. This service can be used in two different ways, either pulling
      updates or having updates pushed to an endpoint on the
      Merchant/Acquirers/Payment Service Provider's system for account numbers
      that they are watching.

      The Benefit Allocation Service (BAS) allows issuers to efficiently manage
      cardholder value propositions in real-time. It enables the assignment and
      replacement of benefits, the freezing and unfreezing of cards, and the
      complete replacement of cards. Historically, benefits were assigned using
      a one-size-fits-all approach, limited by batch processing, which delayed
      critical changes and fragmented card management. BAS revolutionizes this
      process by offering instant, automated solutions on a single platform,
      enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. Its
      flexibility and responsiveness ensure issuers can meet the dynamic needs
      of their cardholders.
