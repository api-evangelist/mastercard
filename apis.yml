      Automatic Billing Updater (ABU) is a web service that provides access to
      updated account credentials (cards). This can be leveraged by
      Merchant/Acquirers/Payment Service Providers to ensure that they always
      have their customers' most up to date card credentials on file; the main
      benefit being a big reduction in declines for recurring and card-on-file
      payments. This service can be used in two different ways, either pulling
      updates or having updates pushed to an endpoint on the
      Merchant/Acquirers/Payment Service Provider's system for account numbers
      that they are watching.

      The Benefit Allocation Service (BAS) allows issuers to efficiently manage
      cardholder value propositions in real-time. It enables the assignment and
      replacement of benefits, the freezing and unfreezing of cards, and the
      complete replacement of cards. Historically, benefits were assigned using
      a one-size-fits-all approach, limited by batch processing, which delayed
      critical changes and fragmented card management. BAS revolutionizes this
      process by offering instant, automated solutions on a single platform,
      enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. Its
      flexibility and responsiveness ensure issuers can meet the dynamic needs
      of their cardholders.

      Today's digital economy has transformed consumer behaviors and
      expectations. As more interactions are conducted virtually, consumers have
      come to expect every company to have a smooth, easy digital onboarding
      process. For financial institutions especially, the balance between
      consumer friction and fraud detection is even more acute when assessing
      thin-file or unbanked consumers. Risk-averse banks often treat
      applications as fraudulent until proven otherwise to protect against
      growing identity fraud, leading to poor user experiences that may drive
      good consumers to competitors.

      makes it easier to manage claims globally within their web apps rather
      than visiting multiple insurance sites. This facilitates claims
      submissions by gathering all details via issuer app before redirecting
      cardholder to claims processing website for pre-selecting benefit and
      pre-filling forms. This also provides capability to search claim status
      within banking app.

      to check that the supplied name(s) and, optionally, Card Verification Code
      (CVC or CVV) for an account match the account records held by the card
      issuer. Mastercard routes validation requests to Mastercard or Visa
      issuers, depending on the account type. The API response will provide
      status values indicating the matching results from the issuer.

      The Mastercard Alert To Control High-risk Merchants (MATCH Pro) system
      allows an Authorized User to assess potential risks associated with a
      Merchant prior to enabling Mastercard acceptance, with the opportunity to
      develop and review enhanced or incremental risk information before
      entering into a Merchant agreement. MATCH Pro is a mandatory system for
      Mastercard Acquirers, unless exempted by Mastercard, or prohibited by law.
      The MATCH Pro database includes customer-reported information about MATCH
      Merchants (and their owners) that an Authorized user has terminated. When
      an Acquirer considers onboarding a MATCH Merchant, MATCH Pro can assist
      Acquirers with risk determinations during onboarding. By making
      independent risk determinations, Acquirers are able to add MATCH Merchants
      who have been added to MATCH PRO.

      Mastercard issuers can use the Payment Acount Management (PAM) API to
      uniformly perform account lifecycle management on accounts held across
      different Mastercard systems. The PAM API can be used to submit lifecycle
      management events that update associated Mastercard Digital Enablement
      Service (MDES) tokens. Automatic Billing Updater (ABU)-implemented issuers
      can also use PAM API to submit real-time account updates that the ABU
      system consumes in near real-time.
